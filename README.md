# Some notes with findings while using meteor

## Online Resources

[meteortips.com](http://meteortips.com) - free online book for beginners

[discovermeteor.com](http://discovermeteor.com) - excellent book as introduction to meteor framework

[PacktPub: Instant Meteor JavaScript Framework Starter](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/instant-meteor-javascript-framework-starter-instant) - book was published quite a while ago (04/2013) and uses (very!) outdated version of Meteor. However, uses nice graphical example app creation of mindmap graphs with nodes and edges rather than one of the usual text based examples (todo, leaderboard...).
